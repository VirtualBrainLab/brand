# brand

Our teal color is (15,187,187) or #0fbbbb

All our text uses **Helvetica**, except the VBL logo which uses **Josefin Sans Thin**, both are in the fonts folder

## Tools

We don't currently show branding in the tools.

## Posters

On posters, make the title 72 pt Helvetica, the smallest text font on your poster should be 18 pt for readable text.

The VBL logo should be in the top right, followed by a vertical line, and then the words "Virtual Brain Lab". See the poster_logo.pdf file for an example.

Blocks of results should be separated from each other by surrounding them with a thin teal line in our standard color.

## Additional colors

If you need more colors for your poster/tool/whatever, use [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) wheel to find them.
